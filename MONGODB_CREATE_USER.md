# How to Create a MongoDB Database User and Password

You need to create a database user in MongoDB Atlas before you can get the connection string. Here's how:

## Step 1: Go to Database Access

1. In MongoDB Atlas, look at the left sidebar
2. Click on **"Security"** (or look for a shield icon 🔒)
3. Click on **"Database Access"**

## Step 2: Add New Database User

1. Click the green **"Add New Database User"** button (top right)
2. A modal will appear

## Step 3: Configure the User

### Authentication Method:
- Select **"Password"** (not "AWS IAM" or "Certificate")

### Username:
- Enter a username (e.g., `loganszeto` or `healthuser`)
- Keep it simple - no spaces or special characters

### Password:
- Click **"Autogenerate Secure Password"** (recommended)
  - OR enter your own password (make it strong!)
- **IMPORTANT:** Copy and save the password immediately - you won't be able to see it again!
- If you autogenerated, copy it to a safe place

### Database User Privileges:
- Select **"Read and write to any database"** (for simplicity)
  - OR "Atlas admin" if you want full access

## Step 4: Create the User

1. Click **"Add User"** at the bottom
2. Wait a few seconds for the user to be created
3. You'll see the new user in the list

## Step 5: Use the Username and Password

Now you can use these credentials in your connection string:

```
mongodb+srv://YOUR_USERNAME:YOUR_PASSWORD@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/health-sync?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

Replace:
- `YOUR_USERNAME` with the username you just created
- `YOUR_PASSWORD` with the password you just created

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Password Security:**
- If your password has special characters (`@`, `#`, `%`, `&`, etc.), you may need to URL-encode them in the connection string
- Or use a password without special characters to avoid issues
- Never share your password or commit it to GitHub

⚠️ **Forgot Password?**
- You can't recover a password in MongoDB Atlas
- You'll need to delete the user and create a new one
- Or reset the password (which generates a new one)

## Quick Checklist

- [ ] Went to Security → Database Access
- [ ] Clicked "Add New Database User"

**Once you have the username and password, you can use them in your MongoDB connection string!** 🚀
